![Goshu](docs/logo.png)

Goshu is a powerful chatbot, written for Python3. Utilising simple YAML configuration files, a fast, extensible module system and useful, configurable logging, Goshu allows you to create your own personalised IRC or Discord bot in no time!

This is a fork/port of my IRC-based [Goshu](https://github.com/goshuirc/goshu) that's designed to work with Discord instead. May the two meet in the middle at some point and form a glorious union.
